The Kawasaki ZXR400 was a Kawasaki motorcycle introduced in 1989. It was one of the first and most popular of the 400 cubic centimetres (24 cu in) sport bikes that swept across Japan and later Europe in the 1990s. It was discontinued in 1999 .[clarification needed] The H model was produced first, and was superseded by the L series in 1991. The L series had increased power output, but less torque, and updated slimmer rear styling.

Homologation Models[edit]
Both the L and H models were produced in a very limited "Sport Production" series, allowing Kawasaki to homologate a higher specification to make them more competitive in the Formula 3 race series, and were only available in Japan.
The H1 Sport Production model was known as ZX400J1, and the H2 equivalent was ZX400J2.The L model dropped the "Sport Production" decals and instead had "400R" on the number board, and was simply known as ZX400M.These models are identified through the VIN, which begins with the digit 3.
The J and M specification included these additions over and above the standard models : Close ratio gearbox, FCR Flatslide carburettors with TPS, adjustable camshafts, lighter rear subframe combined with single seat unit, front suspension with compression & rebound damping, fully adjustable rear suspension, Mitsubishi CDI with a raised rev limit of 15200rpm.
