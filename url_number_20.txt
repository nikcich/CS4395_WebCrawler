The Kawasaki Estrella (called W250 since 2017[1]) is a 249 cc retro[2] standard motorcycle made by Kawasaki since 1992.[3] It has only been available in European and Asian markets. As of 2012, it is only available in Japan.[2] It is a smaller-engine version of the Kawasaki W series. It is popularly used as a bike for modifications and customizations due to its affordable price and classic cafe racer style.[citation needed]
The design of the single-seater model of Kawasaki Estrella is very similar to the Kawasaki model SG 250 1964.[4] This motorcycle was based on a 250-cc engine of the motorcycle manufacturer Meguro, which was taken over by Kawasaki and built including copies of British BSA engines. The design of the two-seater model Gold Star Clubman DBD34 recalls the BSA motorcycle from the 1960s.[5]
