The W650, model year 1999
The Kawasaki W650 is a retro standard motorcycle marketed by Kawasaki for model years 1999-2007 and superseded by the Kawasaki W800.
The "W" in "W650" refers to Kawasaki's W1, W2 and W3 models, manufactured between 1967 and 1975.[1] The "650" refers to the engine displacement.
In 1999, superseding the Zephyr series, Kawasaki introduced the W650, resembling British motorcycles of the early 1960s, notably the Triumph Bonneville.[1] In contrast to British twin-cylinder motorcycles of the period, which featured pushrod engines, the W650 features a shaft-driven bevel-gear overhead camshaft, similar to those found on 1970s Ducati singles and V-twins.[2]
The W650 has a long-stroke engine of 72 mm bore x 80 mm stroke with an anti-vibration balance shaft and modern electronics. In 2006 Kawasaki added a short-stroke W400 model, in Japan. Kawasaki simply combined the same 72 mm bore with a short-throw crankshaft to give a 49 mm stroke and 399 cc (24 cu in) displacement.[3]
In the United States and Canada the W650 was imported for model years 2000-2001. With weak US and Canadian sales and the introduction of the competing "retro" Bonneville by Triumph, Kawasaki concentrated sales in Europe and Japan.[1]
Production of the W400 and W650, unable to meet new emissions standards, ended in 2008.[4] In 2010, the 50 hp (37 kW) W650 was succeeded by the W800, which had a displacement increase to 773 cc (47 cu in) and fuel injection.
