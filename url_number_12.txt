BMX[edit]
Kawasaki BMX bicycles were welded by Triple-A Accessories in southern California in the 1970s.[12] Frames were made from steel and aluminum with TIG and MIG welders.[12] The frames had a rear suspension consisting of a swingarm supported by a spring on each side.[3] The front fork was attached to the frame by a triple clamp but was not telescopic, even though the bottom of the stanchions were covered by a boots to give the appearance of being telescopic.[3] The bikes had banana-style seats and BMX-style handlebars.[3]
MTB[edit]
Kawasaki mountain bikes were sold at Kawasaki motorcycle dealerships in the 1990s.[13] The 1994 KMB 450 model had a rigid steel rear frame and telescoping forks with elastomers.
In 2018, a 34-lb, full-suspension mountain bike with 26-inch wheels and a front disc brake was offered under the Kawasaki brand name.[14]
