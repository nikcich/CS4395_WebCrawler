The Kawasaki W800 is a parallel twin motorcycle produced by Kawasaki from 2011 to 2016, and then since 2019. The W800 is a retro style model that emulates the Kawasaki W series, three models that were produced from 1967 to 1975, and which in turn were based on the British BSA A7.[4] It replaced the W650, which was produced from 1999 to 2007. The W800 has an air-cooled, 773 cc (47 cu in) parallel-twin, four-stroke engine, with shaft and bevel gear driven overhead cam. The carburettor-fuelled W650 was discontinued because it could not meet emissions regulations,[3] so the W800 engine is fuel injected. Unlike the W650, the W800 does not have a kickstart.[5]
The retro style includes a highly polished, gloss-painted and pinstriped fuel tank, as well as a ribbed saddle, wire wheels and a special W-logo on both sides of the tank, which refers to the W1-model.[6] Besides the regular W800 model there is the W800 Special Edition. In 2012 the S.E. has gold-anodised wheelrims, 2 black exhausts, black engine.[7] For both models, there is the Café Style option, with a front cowl, and a cafe racer inspired seat.[1]
Kevin Ash wrote, "the performance feels distinctly retro too, but in a good way, as the W800 purrs along. The sound is friendly and mellow and the engine pulls well enough not to feel breathless, as the W650 could". The 360° engine has a balance shaft to reduce vibration.[6]
