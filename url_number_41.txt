The Kawasaki KLR250/KL250D was a motorcycle produced from 1984 to 2005 as the successor to the 1978 to 1983 KL250C, with only minor changes during the model run. This lightweight dualsport motorcycle was used for several years by the US military for a variety of tasks, including messenger duty and reconnaissance.[citation needed]

It was produced by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan and exported to many parts of the world, including the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Australia. The Chilean national police ("Carabineros de Chile") made extensive use of the KLR250. It is similar in appearance to the larger KLR650. The KLR250 shares many engine parts with an ATV sold by Kawasaki, the KSF250 "Mojave".
In the USA the KLR250 was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model run and was replaced by the KLX250S in 2006. In other markets the KLX250 was introduced in 2001 and has been sold to the current day.
